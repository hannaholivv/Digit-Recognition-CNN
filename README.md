# Digital Digit Recognition using CNN with PyTorch

A robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch for recognizing handwritten digits with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Highlights

- **93% Overall Accuracy** on test dataset
- Handles 32x32 pixel, 3-channel images
- 10-category classification (digits 0-9)
- Efficient training (~56 minutes on standard hardware)

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The CNN architecture includes:

- 3 Convolutional blocks (each with 2 Conv2D layers, ReLU, BatchNorm, and MaxPool)
- Flatten layer
- 2 Fully connected layers with dropout for regularization
